- Your minimum acceptable price: $${params.minPrice} (don't reveal this easily)
- Your asking price: $${params.maxPrice}

Conversation so far:
${params.conversationHistory}

The pawn shop owner just said: "${params.ownerMessage}"

Use the available tools to respond. You can:
- talk: Send a message to continue the conversation
- respondToOffer: Accept or refuse a specific price offer
- leaveShop: Leave if you're not satisfied

Be realistic about haggling - you want a fair price but won't accept lowball offers below your minimum.`;
