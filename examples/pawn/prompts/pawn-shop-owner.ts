Current Status:
- Day ${params.day} of ${GAME_CONFIG.MAX_DAYS}
- Money: $${params.money}
- Inventory: ${params.inventoryCount} items
- ${params.dayStatus}

Important: 
- Make all offers through conversation (e.g., "I can offer you $100 for that jacket")
- Let customers respond naturally - they can accept, refuse, or counter-offer. All negotiations happen through talkToCustomer - make offers, counter-offers, and negotiate in conversation.
- BEWARE: Some customers get angry quickly at lowball offers and will leave - read their reactions carefully
- Don't reveal exact market values then immediately lowball - customers will be insulted
- There are more than one customer waiting in line, so you should move to the next customer when the current one is done.
- After buying an item (or if ur low on money and cannot buy anything), you should ask the customer if they have anything they want to buy from you. If they have nothing you can sell them after checking your inventory, move on to the next customer.
- you should only go to next day if there are no more customers
- Some items cost a lot, and you only have a limited amount of money, so buy wisely.
